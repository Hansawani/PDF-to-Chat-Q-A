# PDF-to-Chat-Q-A
This project aims to develop a chatbot that utilises generative AI to allow users to upload multiple PDF files and ask questions to the AI model about their domain specific PDFs and get quick answers. This is useful if the data to be read by the user is very large and they require the assistance of an AI model.
Languages, technologies and techniques used in this project are:
1. Streamlit
2. Langface
3. Huggingface
4. Python
5. FAISS
6. One-Shot prompting
7. Chain of thoughts prompting
